# FINAL PROJECT
## OLIST BRAZILIAN E-COMMERCE: Business Analysis and Recommendation System

### Project Overview

This repository contains the final project for the Purwadhika Digital Talent Incubator Program. The project overview is focusing on customer behavior analysis and a recommendation system for Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce company based in Brazil. The project aims to provide solutions to the problems faced by the company through the approaches of comprehensive business analysis and machine learning.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into several sections, each addressing different aspects of the analysis and model-building process:

1. **Business Problem**
2. **Data Understanding**
3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
5. **Modeling: Recommendation System**
6. **Conclusion and Recommendation**

### Business Background

Olist significantly impacts the Brazilian e-commerce landscape by enabling small businesses to compete on a larger scale. By simplifying the selling process and offering access to a broad network of marketplaces, Olist helps merchants reach more customers without the complexities of managing multiple sales channels and logistics on their own. This democratization of online selling supports the growth of Brazil’s e-commerce market and encourages entrepreneurship across the country.

### Problem Statement

Olist's average quarterly revenue of approximately BRL 171,170 from 2016 to 2018 represents a minor share of the Brazilian e-commerce market, which was valued at USD 19.5 billion in 2017, USD 20.2 billion in 2018, and USD 23.7 billion in 2019. Despite the market's growth, Olist has struggled to increase its revenue and customer base, with data from 2016 to 2018 showing that 97% of customers make only one purchase and do not return, leaving only 3% as repeat buyers. This low retention rate significantly impacts Olist’s growth and revenue potential, indicating a misalignment between the products offered and customer needs, likely due to the lack of an effective recommendation system.

### Goals

1. Conducting comprehensive business analysis to identify factors causing the low customer retention rate based on customer behavior from the questions that have been stated.

2. Developing an appropriate recommendation model based on customer behavior analysis to encourage customers to find products they are interested in, increase cross-selling opportunities, enhance their shopping experience, and thus encourage them to return, ultimately improving the customer retention rate.

3. Provide a simulation illustration of how and to what extent an increase in customer retention rate can impact revenue and company growth through a recommendation system.

### Analytical Approach

1. Content-Based Filtering: This model recommends items based on the similarity of products.

2. Collaborative Filtering: This model makes recommendations based on considering user preferences from their ratings of other items.

3. Hybrid Recommendation: This approach combines both content-based and collaborative filtering methods and aims to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations.
